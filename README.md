This is a 20 question timed quiz built with React to test your knowledge of The Lord of Rings books. Some notable features include

- Loads a 3D model of “the precious” and creates reflections of fire on the ring using an environment map.
- Uses animations and transitions to change the scenery of the background as the quiz progresses.
- Displays quiz results with a different quote from the book depending on how well you did. Confetti canons if you get a 100%.
